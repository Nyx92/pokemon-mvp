/**
 * GET /api/cron/refresh-prices ← recommended schedule: once a day (cron-job.org)
 * POST /api/cron/refresh-prices ← kept for local curl testing
 *
 * The CHEAP, frequent half of the two-tier pricing strategy (see also
 * /api/cron/backfill-prices for the expensive, occasional half). This job
 * only ever writes *today's* price — it never touches history — so it's
 * safe to run daily indefinitely without approaching JustTCG's call quota:
 *
 *   - Raw prices for the whole catalog go through JustTCG's v1 batch
 *     endpoint, 100 cards per call (~13 calls for 1,200+ cards).
 *   - Graded prices need v2 (v1 doesn't return them), so those are one call
 *     per card — but only for cards that actually have a graded Listing,
 *     which today is a small fraction of the catalog.
 *
 * Total: roughly (catalog size / 100) + (graded-listed card count) calls
 * per run — under 20 today, and still cheap even as the catalog grows.
 *
 * For local testing:
 *   curl http://localhost:3000/api/cron/refresh-prices \
 *     -H "Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>"

/**
 * Writes a whole set of today's prices in a small, fixed number of queries

 * always non-null across both games, so Postgres can't enforce a real unique
 * constraint across (pokemonCardId, riftboundCardId, variant, capturedAt) —
 * a unique index treats any row with a null column as distinct from every
 * other row, so it silently allows duplicates instead of rejecting them, on
 * both games (one of the two ID columns is null on every row). That rules
 * out a native `upsert`, so this instead mirrors backfillVariant's read-many
 * -then-write-many shape: one findMany per game covering every card being
 * written this call, one createMany for the rows that don't exist yet, and
 * an update only for the rare same-day rerun that actually collides.
