// The decorative chrome (background, tabs, animated header) around the
// marketplace's card grid. Split out from page.tsx so that file can stay an
// async Server Component doing the initial data fetch — @mui/material's Box/
// Typography and framer-motion's motion.div all rely on client-side context
// (theming, animation) that crashes Next's server-side "Collecting page
// data" pass when rendered directly from a Server Component (surfaced as
// "TypeError: (0 , o.unstable_createUseMediaQuery) is not a function" at
// build time). Marketplace itself (MarketPlace.tsx) is already its own
// "use client" component, so it's passed in as `children` rather than
// imported here directly — no need to duplicate that boundary.
