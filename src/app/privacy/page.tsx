        <li>
          <strong>Usage data:</strong> basic technical information (such as

        We share information only with the service providers needed to run
        the Service: <strong>Stripe</strong> (payment processing),{" "}
        <strong>Supabase</strong> (database and image storage), and{" "}
        <strong>Resend</strong> (transactional email delivery). Each of
        these providers only receives the information necessary to perform

      <p>

      <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain your account and transaction information for as long as
        your account is active, or as needed to comply with legal
        obligations (e.g. financial record-keeping) and resolve disputes.
      </p>

        Note that we may need to retain certain transaction records even
        after an account deletion request, where required for legal or
        accounting purposes.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable technical measures to protect your information,
        including password hashing, encrypted connections (HTTPS), and
        access controls on our database. No system is completely secure,
        and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

        The Service is not directed at children under 18. We do not

        of the Service after an update constitutes acceptance of the
        revised policy.
