/**
 * This file sets up and exports a single shared Prisma Client instance.
 *
 * âœ… What it does:
 * - Ensures we donâ€™t create multiple Prisma Client instances during hot reloads (Next.js dev mode).
 * - Configures Prisma logging for debugging queries, errors, and warnings.
 * - Exports a `prisma` object you can use anywhere to query your Postgres DB.
 *
 * âœ… Why itâ€™s needed:
 * - Without this, each time Next.js reloads, a new PrismaClient instance is created.
 *   That can exhaust database connections and crash your app.
 * - By attaching Prisma to the `global` object, we reuse the same instance in development.
 *
 * âœ… How it works:
 * - `globalForPrisma` acts like a cache for Prisma on the global object.
 * - If no Prisma client exists yet, create one.
 * - If weâ€™re in development, store it globally so hot reloads reuse it.
 * - In production, always create a new instance (to avoid cross-request leakage).
 *
 * ðŸ‘‰ TL;DR: This file is your "database connector."
 * You import `{ prisma }` anywhere you need to talk to the DB.
