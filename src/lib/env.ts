// src/lib/env.ts
//
// Validates required environment variables once, at import time, so a
// missing/misconfigured var fails loudly and immediately at app boot instead
// of surfacing later as a confusing runtime error deep inside a request
// handler (e.g. `new Stripe(undefined)` throwing a cryptic SDK error, or a
// Prisma connection string failing hundreds of requests in).
//
// Import this module once, as early as possible (see src/lib/prisma.ts,
// which is itself imported by nearly every API route), so the check runs
// as soon as the app boots.
//
// This does NOT rewrite every existing `process.env.X as string` call site
// to use `env.X` — that's a larger refactor left for later. New/changed code
// is encouraged to `import { env } from "@/lib/env"` instead of reaching
// into `process.env` directly, since `env.X` is guaranteed non-empty here
// while `process.env.X as string` is just an unchecked type assertion.
//
// Var names below match what this project's code actually reads via
// `process.env.X` (checked against src/lib/prisma.ts, src/lib/auth.ts,
// src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts, and the Supabase `createClient(...)`
// call sites in src/app/api/cards/route.ts, src/app/api/cards/[id]/route.ts
// and prisma/seed.ts) — NOT necessarily the names a generic Next.js +
// Supabase starter would use (this project has no NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL /
// NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY; server code reads SUPABASE_URL +
// SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY directly, since Supabase is only ever touched
// server-side here).
