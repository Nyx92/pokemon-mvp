 * Converts a dollar amount (e.g. 19.99) into cents (e.g. 1999).

 * WHY:
 * - All monetary values in the database are stored as integers (cents).
 * - This avoids floating point precision issues (e.g. 0.1 + 0.2 problems).
 * - Stripe and most payment systems also require amounts in cents.
 *
 * WHEN TO USE:
 * - Before saving user input into the database.
 * - Before sending amounts to Stripe as `unit_amount`.

 * IMPORTANT:
 * - This returns a number (not a formatted string).
