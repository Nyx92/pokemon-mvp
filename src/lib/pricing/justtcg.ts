// Thin client for JustTCG (https://justtcg.com/docs), the vendor that
// replaced pokemonpricetracker.com. Unlike that old vendor, JustTCG covers
// Riftbound as well as Pokemon.
//
// Two endpoints, two very different jobs:
//   - fetchCardVariants (/v2/cards): one card per call, but the only one
//     that returns graded (PSA/CGC/BGS) prices and a configurable
//     price_history window (up to 1 year). Used by the occasional deep
//     backfill (see /api/cron/backfill-prices).
//   - fetchCardVariantsBatch (/v1/cards): up to 100 cards per call, but raw
//     conditions only, no graded prices, and a fixed ~7-day history we don't
//     use. Used by the frequent, cheap refresh (see /api/cron/refresh-prices)
//     to keep today's raw price current without burning the daily call quota.

// connection) open indefinitely instead of failing one card/batch and
// moving on the way every catch block here already expects.
